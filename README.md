## üß† Author Notes

This app is designed to be robust, modular and readable. Future enhancements

## üîÆ Future Improvements

### 1. Introduce Use Cases (Clean Architecture)
- Isolate business logic from ViewModels for better testing and maintainability.

### 2. Room Caching Layer
- Minimize API calls and allow offline access.

### 3. Pagination for Breed Images
- Avoid downloading large image sets all at once using Paging 3 or manual pagination with LazyColumn.

### 4. Error Categories
- Right now errors are generic. Classify them:
  - Network Error
  - API Error
  - Timeout
  - Empty Data
- UX: Show meaningful messages or retry options.

### 5. Better UX Enhancements
- Skeleton loading with Accompanist Placeholder
- Lottie animations for empty/error states
- Swipe to refresh
- Smooth image fade-in animations

### 6. Testing Enhancements
- Add UI tests with ComposeTestRule
- Mock network calls using MockWebServer
- Add coverage reports (e.g. Jacoco)

### 7. CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions or Bitrise for:
  - Build + Unit Test
  - Lint + Static Analysis (Detekt)
  - Test Coverage Reports

### 8. Modularization
Split into feature-based modules:
- :core
- :feature-breedlist
- :feature-breedimages
- :data, :domain

Improves scalability, build speed, testability.

### 9. Theming and Dark Mode
- Add proper support for dynamic colors
- Let user switch themes via settings screen

### 10. Image Details Screen
- Tap an image ‚Üí open fullscreen with zoom
- Show image metadata if available
